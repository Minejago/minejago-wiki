	<p>Welcome to the automatically generated Wiki of Minejago!</p>
	<p>
		This Wiki is automatically generated from the Modonomicon Files in the Minejago Repository.
		Therefore, it can be a bit janky, with missing names or
		unexpected errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you encounter any issues, please reach out in the Minejago Discord found <a
			href="/category/mod_news/entry/mod_news"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a
		>
		or submit an issue
		<a href="https://github.com/thomasglasser/minejago-wiki/issues/new" rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>here</a
		>!
	</p>

	<p>You can now select which Addon Mods you want to include in the wiki! Currently available:</p>
	<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
		<li>
				Immersion Pack (included in mod)
		</li>
		<li>
				Potion Pot Pack (included in mod)
		</li>

<!--			>-->
<!--				Too Many Glyphs (Beta, repository doesn't have all the necessary information)-->
<!--			</a>-->
<!--		</li>-->
	</ul>
	<p>
		Not all Addons are available for the current version and addon documentation functionality is
		less tested than Minejago Wiki functionality. Use at your own risk.
	</p>
	<p>
		Direct links to addon pages or refreshing addon pages is currently not supported, since the
		server doesn't know which addons to load.
	</p>
